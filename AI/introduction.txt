Aritificial intelligence - An intelligent system that can replicate the behaviour of humens are described and being developed as AI. 
As a humen being the common behaviours are - Reasoning, learning, problem solving, perceptions. this behaviour can be adopted and implemented into the
system and make them intelligent to perform tasks that humen do.

Technically, An Aritificial intelligence is an intelligent system that can learn and can resoning upon it's knowleged and implement generalized 
decisions to produce results or solve problem.


Most Common modules of AI - Search algorithms, logical reasoning, reasoning with uncertainity (When possibility of something to happen is uncertain)\

An intelligent system that can simulate the humen intelligence and comprehense patterns and perform cognitivly.
